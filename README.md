<h2>Portfolio</h2>

<p> This is my portfolio showcasing my most recent projects. It is intended to give potential employers an insight into my skills and what I can bring to an organisation.</p>
  
<p>This portfolio was built using ReactJS with ReactRouter for navigation.</p>

<p>There is a short introduction section about me and the languages and frameworks I am comfortable working with</p>

<p>There is also a page containing brief notes about some of my most recent or detailed projects, along with a link to their repositories on Github.</p>

<p>Contact links are contained within for any enquiries about freelance or contracted work. Get in touch!</p>
